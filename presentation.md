SWBAT:

- apply property tests to their own code
  - formulate properties
    - know what a property is
      - example: commutativity
        assumed knowledge: most people know that `n*m == m*n`
      - example: encoding/decoding
        assumed knowledge: what serialization and deserialization are "supposed" to do
    - answer what properties their code has
      - example: sorting algorithm
        assumed knoweldge: what "sorting" means
        - rephrase the intent of the code
      - example: vending machine spec
        - introduce the vending machine example
          - what properties does this spec have?
  - write well-formed generators/shrinkers
- apply model testing to their own code

Vending machine spec:

It works how you'd expect a vending machine to work. Specifically:

1. Put money into the vending machine
2. Push the button for the drink you want
3. Get the drink

Level 2:

- only accept payment if you can provide the requested drink
- only accept non-exact payments if you can make change
- if there's no money in the machine:
  - pushing a drink button doesn't dispense a drink
  - pushing the refund button doesn't dispense change

## 1b. What's a property?

## A property is a thing that's always true about some code.
